      <h3 id="what-does-yue-mean-">What does Yue mean?</h3>
      <p>It means moon in Chinese.</p>
      <h3 id="why-a-new-gui-library-what-s-the-differences-between-yue-and-xxx-">Why a new GUI library? / What&#39;s the
        differences between Yue and XXX?</h3>
      <p>When writing GUI programs, I had been searching for a library that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uses native widgets;</li>
        <li>Works on all major desktop platforms;</li>
        <li>Has a modern and clean C++ interface;</li>
        <li>Has good support for High DPI;</li>
        <li>Uses windowless controls on Windows;</li>
        <li>Generates small executable size;</li>
        <li>With friendly license for closed source apps.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There were lots of good GUI toolkits, but I could not find one that meets all above conditions, so I decided to
        write my own.</p>
      <h3 id="do-i-need-to-open-source-my-project-when-using-yue-">Do I need to open source my project when using Yue?
      </h3>
      <p>Unless you have modified Yue&#39;s source code and linked your project with Yue statically, there is no
        requirements on which license your project should use.</p>
      <h3 id="your-website-looks-shabby-">Your website looks shabby.</h3>
      <p>I have put priority on the documentation site, I&#39;ll improve the homepage in future.</p>
      <h3 id="will-yue-support-xaml-qml-">Will Yue support XAML/QML?</h3>
      <p>No, Yue will always be a widgets library, there is no plan to implement high level languages like XAML/QML in
        Yue. The goal of Yue is to provide a low-level library that can be used to easily implement things like React
        Native and XAML/QML.</p>
      <p>However Yue will support creating widgets from simple XML descriptions, since it is essential for writing a
        visual GUI builder.</p>
      <h3 id="what-s-the-minimum-version-of-windows-supported-">What&#39;s the minimum version of Windows supported?
      </h3>
      <p>By using Win32 API and GDI+, Yue can work on Windows &gt;= 7. It is also possible to make Yue work on Windows
        XP with some efforts, but this is not on my roadmap.</p>
      <h3 id="why-using-windowless-controls-on-windows-">Why using windowless controls on Windows?</h3>
      <p>The Win32 Common Controls have a few problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>most controls can not be nested;</li>
        <li>with large numbers of controls performance would be slow.</li>
        <li>it is hard/impossible to make controls transparent;</li>
        <li>it is hard/impossible to solve the flickering problem;</li>
        <li>it is hard/impossible to handle controls&#39; mouse and keyboard events;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>(Whether it is hard or impossible depends on the types of controls.)</p>
      <p>To make the windowless controls still look native, most controls are drawn with the UxTheme API, which should
        be the same with how Windows itself renders Win32 Common Controls.</p>
      <p>However with windowless controls we also lose accessibility by default, my plan is to use the UI Automation
        provider API to provide accessibility interface for the windowless controls.</p>
      <h3 id="are-all-widgets-windowless-on-windows-">Are all widgets windowless on Windows?</h3>
      <p>No, currently text input related widgets are still implemented by using Win32 Common Controls, because it is
        rather tough to implement a text input widget from scratch, and I have to focus on more important things first.
      </p>
      <p>In future I&#39;ll make all widgets windowless, but it might be optional since it may bloat the size of
        executable.</p>
      <h3 id="why-using-gdi-instead-of-direct2d-">Why using GDI+ instead of Direct2D?</h3>
      <p>Because I was more familiar with GDI+, I&#39;ll migrate the painting code to Direct2D in future.</p>
      <p>Note that most controls are drawn with UxTheme instead of GDI+, so unless you are doing very heavy custom
        animation with the drawing API, there is no need to worry about the performance of GDI+.</p>
